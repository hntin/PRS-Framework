Each solutionwas scored in inverse proportion to the length of the shortest interval containing it. Eachdocument was scored by the sum of the scores of solutions within it. Whenever the abovestrategy yielded less than 1000 documents, documents satisfying successively weaker querieswere added with lower rank. Our results...
