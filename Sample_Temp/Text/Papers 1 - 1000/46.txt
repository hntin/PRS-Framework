Web searchers reformulate their queries, as they adapt to search engine behavior, learn more about a topic, or simply correct typing errors. Automatic query rewriting can help user web search, by augmenting a user's query, or replacing the query with one likely to retrieve better results. One example of query-rewriting is spell-correction. We may also be interested in changing words to synonyms or other related terms. For Japanese, the opportunities for improving results are greater than for languages with a single character set, since documents may be written in multiple character sets, and a user may express the same meaning using different character sets. We give a description of the characteristics of Japanese search query logs and manual query reformulations carried out by Japanese web searchers. We use characteristics of Japanese query reformulations to extend previ- ous work on automatic query rewriting in English, taking into account the Japanese writing system. We intro- duce several new features for building models resulting from this difference and discuss their impact on auto- matic query rewriting. We also examine enhancements in the form of rules which block conversion between some character sets, to address Japanese homophones. The precision/recall curves show significant improvement with the new feature set and blocking rules, and are often better than the English counterpart
