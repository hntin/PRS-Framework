It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of classical models is the need to estimate a relevance model with no training data. We propose a novel technique for estimating such models us- ing the query alone. We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models. Our ex- periments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data
