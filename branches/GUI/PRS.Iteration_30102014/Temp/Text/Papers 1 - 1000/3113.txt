The Da&pace& a three dimensional physical space 100 kilometers above and 10 kilometers below the surface of earth that is accessible to the network. It is addressed geographically as opposed to the cur- rent "logical" addressing scheme of the Internet. With the enormous 128 bit addressing space of IP version 6, one can individually address every cubic centimeter of physical space on earth with approximately 80 bits of area code. This would include every street, building, room, basement or even drawer of a desk. The Dataspace would thus serve as the host for the entire part of the physical world that is connected to the network. The billions of objects populating the Dataspace, each aware of its own geographic location2 will form "dataflocks", mobile object classes which can be selectively queried, monitored and controlled. To support the datas- pace, we propose a version of the multicast pro- tocol called "spacecast". Here, the network plays the role of a Database machine, handling queries through spacecast which "illuminate' ' selected data cubes and gather multiple responses from the ob- jects that respond to the query. The user will in- teract with the Dataspace through spacecast in the same way that a person interacts with his physical environment through the information in reflected light waves.
