Four baseline experiments using standard In- dri retrieval facilities and simple query formula- tion techniques and two experiments using more advanced formulations (dependence models and pseudo-relevance feedback) are described. All of the experiments perform substantially better than the median performance of automatic runs but exhibit lower estimated precision and recall at B than the reference Boolean run.
