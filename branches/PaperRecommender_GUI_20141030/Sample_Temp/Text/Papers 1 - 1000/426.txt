The areas of On-Line Algorithms and Machine Learning areboth concerned with problems of making decisions about the presentbased only on knowledge of the past. Although these areas differ in termsof their emphasis and the problems typically studied, there are a collectionof results in Computational Learning Theory that fit nicely into the&quot;on-line algorithms&quot; framework. This survey article discusses some of theresults, models, and open problems from Computational Learning Theorythat seem ...
