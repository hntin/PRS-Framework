Abstract Query processing costs on large text databases are dominated,by the need to retrieve and scan the inverted list of each query term. Here we show that query response time for conjunctive Boolean queries and for informal ranked queries can be dramatically reduced, at little cost in terms of storage, by the inclusion of an internal index in each inverted list. This method,has been applied in a retrieval system for a collection of nearly two million short documents. Our experimental results show that the self- indexing strategy adds less than 20% to the size of the inverted le, but, for Boolean queries of 5{10 terms, can reduce processing time to under one fth of the previous cost. Similarly, ranked queries of 40{50 terms can be evaluated in as little as 25% of the previous time, with little or no loss of retrieval eectiveness.
