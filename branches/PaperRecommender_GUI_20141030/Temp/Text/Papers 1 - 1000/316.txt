With the increased availability of personal computers with attached sensors to capture their environment, there is a big opportunity forcontext-aware applications; these automatically provide information and/or take actions according to the user's present context, as detected by sensors. When well designed, these applications provide an opportunity to tailor the provision of information closely to the user's current needs. A sub-set of context-aware applications arediscrete applications, where discrete pieces of information are attached to individual contexts, to be triggered when the user enters those contexts. The advantage of discrete applications is that authoring them can be solely a creative process rather than a programming process: it can be a task akin to creating simple web pages. This paper looks at a general system that can be used in any discrete context-aware application. It propounds a general triggering rule, and investigates how this rule applies in practical applications.
