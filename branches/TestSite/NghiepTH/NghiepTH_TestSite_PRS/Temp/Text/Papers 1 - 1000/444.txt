Abstract The HARD track of TREC 2004 aims to improve the accuracy of information retrieval through the use of three techniques: (1) query metadata that better describes the information need, (2) focused and time-limited interaction with the searcher through \clarication forms", and (3) incorporation of passage-level relevance judgments,and retrieval. Participation in all three aspects of the track was excellent this year with about 10 groups trying something in each area. No group was able to achieve huge gains in eectiveness using these techniques, but some improvements were found and enthusiasm for the clarication,forms (in particular) remains high. The track will run again in TREC 2005.
