The proliferation of text databases within large organiza- tions and on the Internet makes it difficult for a person to know which databases to search. Given language models that describe the contents of each database, a database se- lection algorithm such as GlOSS can provide assistance by automatically selecting appropriate databases for an infor- mation need. Current practice is that each database pro- vides its language model upon request, but this cooperative approach has important limitations. This paper demonstrates that cooperation is not required. Instead, the database selection service can construct its own language models by sampling database contents via the nor- mal process of running queries and retrieving documents. Although random sampling is not possible, it can be ap- proximated with carefully selected queries. This sampling approach avoids the limitations that characterize the coop- erative approach, and also enables additional capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that accurate language models can be learned from a relatively small number of queries and documents.
