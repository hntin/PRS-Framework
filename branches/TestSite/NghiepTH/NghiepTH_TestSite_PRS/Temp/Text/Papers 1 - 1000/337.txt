We explore the use of phrase and proximity terms in the con- text of web retrieval, which is dierent from traditional ad-hoc retrieval both in document structure and in query characteristics. We show that for this type of task, the usage of both phrase and proximity terms is highly beneficial for early precision as well as for overall retrieval eec- tiveness. We also analyze why phrase and proximity terms are far more eective for web retrieval than for ad-hoc retrieval.
