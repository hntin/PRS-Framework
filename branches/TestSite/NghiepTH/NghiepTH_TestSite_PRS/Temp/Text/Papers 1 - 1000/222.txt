Query expansion, in the form of pseudo-relevance feedback or relevance feedback, is a common technique used to im- prove retrieval effectiveness. Most previous approaches have ignored important issues, such as the role of features and the importance of modeling term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a robust query expansion technique based on the Markov random field model for information retrieval. The technique, called latent concept expansion, provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expan- sion. Furthermore, the use of arbitrary features within the model provides a powerful framework for going beyond sim- ple term occurrence features that are implicitly used by most other expansion techniques. We evaluate our tech- nique against relevance models, a state-of-the-art language modeling query expansion technique. Our model demon- strates consistent and significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across several TREC data sets. We also de- scribe how our technique can be used to generate mean- ingful multi-term concepts for tasks such as query sugges- tion/reformulation.
