Search and detection technology has been a focus of DARPA and ARDA research programs since the TIPSTER program began in the early 1990s (Harman 1992). A num-ber of innovations have been developed in this research, resulting in very significant improvements in the effective-ness of search tools. The Inquery search engine (Callan et al. 1995), developed at the University of Massachusetts for the TIPSTER project, provided a query language capable of representing complex queries in a probabilistic framework and was used in a number of government and commercial applications.
