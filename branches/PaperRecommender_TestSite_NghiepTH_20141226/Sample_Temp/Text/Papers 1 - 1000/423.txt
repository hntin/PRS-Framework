Users looking for documents within specific cat- egories may have a difficult time locating valuable documents using general purpose search engines. We present an automated method for learning query modifications that can dramatically improve preci- sion for locating pages within specified categories using web search engines. We also present a clas- sification procedure that can recognize pages in a specific category with high precision, using textual content, text location, and HTML structure. Evalu- ation shows that the approach is highly effective for locating personal homepages and calls for papers. These algorithms are used to improve category spe- cific search in the Inquirus 2 search engine.
