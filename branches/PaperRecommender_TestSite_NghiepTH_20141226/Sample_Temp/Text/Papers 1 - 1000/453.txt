We study distributional similarity measures for the purpose of improving probability estima- tion for unseen cooccurrences. Our contribu- tions are three-fold: an empirical comparison of a broad range of measures; a classification of similarity functions based on the information that they incorporate; and the introduction of a novel function that is superior at evaluating potential proxy distributions.
