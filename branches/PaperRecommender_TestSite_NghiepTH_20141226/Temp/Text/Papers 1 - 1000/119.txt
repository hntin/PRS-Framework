This paper discusses the two major query evaluation strategies used in large text retrieval systems and analyzes the performance of these strategies. We then discuss several optimization techniques that can be used to reduce evaluation costs and present simulation results to compare the performance of these optimization techniques when evaluating natural language queries with a collection of full text legal materials.
