This paper develops a fast method for solving linear SVMs with L2 loss function that is suited for large scale data mining tasks such as text classification. Th is is done by modifying the finite Newton method of Mangasarian in several ways. Experiments indicate that the method is much faster than decomposition methods such as SVMlight, SMO and BSVM (e.g., 4-100 fold), especially when the number of examples is large. The paper also suggests ways of extending the method to other loss functions such as the modified Huber's loss function and the L1 loss function, and also for solving ordinal regression.
