We survey the most widely-used algorithms for smoothing models for language n -gram modeling. We then present an extensive empirical comparison of several of these smoothing techniques, including those described by Jelinek and Mercer (1980); Katz (1987); Bell, Cleary and Witten (1990); Ney, Essen and Kneser (1994), and Kneser and Ney (1995). We investigate how factors such as training data size, training corpus (e.g. Brown vs. Wall Street Journal), count cutoffs, and n -gram order (bigram vs. trigram) affect the relative performance of these methods, which is measured through the cross-entropy of test data. We find that these factors can significantly affect the relative performance of models, with the most significant factor being training data size. Since no previous comparisons have examined these factors systematically, this is the first thorough characterization of the relative performance of various algorithms. In addition, we introduce methodologies for analyzing smoothing algorithm efficacy in detail, and using these techniques we motivate a novel variation of Kneserï¿½Ney smoothing that consistently outperforms all other algorithms evaluated. Finally, results showing that improved language model smoothing leads to improved speech recognition performance are presented
