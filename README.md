# Paper Recommender
### Introduction
This is a general framework for relevant scientific paper recommendation. This framework was developed for experimental purpose in our research project.

We also built seveval datasets for scientific paper recommendation experiments based on a novel <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.04422.pdf">method to build ground truth data</a>. The dataset contains metadata of over 4,000,000 scientific papers in the computer science, crawled from <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>.
